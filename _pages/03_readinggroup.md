From the intellectual masterminds who brought you the critically acclaimed _Architecture and Utopia_, _Uneven Development_, and _Karl Marxâ€™s Ecosocialism: Capital, Nature, and the Unfinished Critique of Political Economy_ comes a new reading group for Henri Lefebvre's classic, beloved of architecture students everywhere, _The Production of Space_! This group, hereafter known as the __Montagskreis__, meets every Monday at 7pm EST beginning July 26th on Zoom.

Please add notes/quotes/whatever pertaining to the reading in the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sAV_hEebuSJzTKsod17S4M4xhYSgPrblMrxaxqcOgco/edit?usp=sharing">communal Gdoc</a>.

Sign up by emailing unevendevelopment [at] protonmail.com or, preferably, dming me on Twitter because it's annoying checking the email all the time
