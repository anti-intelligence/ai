<h3>Resources for reading group for Manfredo Tafuri's Architecture and Utopia</h3>

**NEXT MEETING THURSDAY! 6PM EASTERN STANDARD TIME!!!**
We began with "Toward a Critique of Architectural Ideology", Tafuri's essay which was later expanded into *Architecture and Utopia*. This essay is available for download <a href="https://ufile.io/8vu6jt9h">here</a>. We are now on Chapter 3 of the book, available for download <a href="https://anti-intelligence.space/assets/Tafuri%20-%20Architecture%20and%20Utopia-web.pdf">here</a>. And by popular demand, <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1coCBJKtWNJm9JHkPLbHo_lwmWE4qhD6i4ZMmCT-WKLk/edit?usp=sharing">here</a> are my notes for the past few meetings.
